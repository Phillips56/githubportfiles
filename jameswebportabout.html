    <h1> Hi my name is James here's a summary of my expertise.</h1>
    <p>With a bachelor’s degree in communications from the University of Denver and a strong background spanning sales, customer service, and data-driven solutions, I believe my diverse skill set aligns well with the requirements of this role.
    <p>During my undergraduate studies, I gained a foundation in cultural studies and civic engagement, which enhanced my ability to communicate effectively and adapt to diverse audiences. While in college, I honed my customer service skills in a high-call-volume remote environment at HomeServe USA, where I resolved client concerns efficiently. </p>
    <p>Post-graduation, I joined Yelp as an advertising sales representative. In this fast-paced, target-driven environment, I mastered the art of cold calling (averaging 100 calls daily), closing deals, and retaining clients by helping them maximize their ROI through personalized guidance on our platform. This experience deepened my sales acumen and taught me the importance of tailoring solutions to meet customer needs.</p>
    <p>Seeking greater intellectual and technical challenges, I transitioned to Cologix, a hyperscale data center provider. There, I successfully sold colocation services by emphasizing the advantages of low-latency connectivity and secure cloud on-ramps to major platforms like Oracle, AWS, and Google. This role introduced me to the transformative potential of cloud solutions, further solidifying my interest in the intersection of technology and business.</p>
    <p>Most recently, I refined my interpersonal and analytical skills at Charles Schwab, where I provided guidance on brokerage accounts and engaged clients with discovery questions to drive account retention. The exposure to financial markets ignited my curiosity about economics and financial theories, leading me to pursue advanced knowledge through self-study with the Corporate Finance Institute and proficiency in SQL—both of which are invaluable in understanding customer behaviors and driving data-driven solutions.
